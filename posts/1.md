title: "Why Junior Developers Should Learn TypeScript Directly"

paragraphOne: "After creating my first full-stack application in JavaScript, I realized that it's easy to write poor-quality code because the compiler doesn't provide warnings, and errors only occur at runtime. During my first internship at Ballyâ€™s with other students, I noticed that when the application was built with JavaScript, many of them wrote bad code. This led to developing bad habits and the need to relearn proper coding practices. For example, variables were often reused with different data types, which led to unexpected behavior and runtime errors that were challenging to trace."
paragraphTwo: "Based on my personal experience with both TypeScript and JavaScript, and my observations of other students, I strongly advise junior developers to start with static typing. Learning TypeScript is beneficial not only for JavaScript but also for other statically typed languages. It enhances the development process with superior tooling and auto-completion. By starting with TypeScript, you will develop good coding habits and gain a deeper understanding of how to construct scalable applications, which will give you a competitive advantage in the job market. After transitioning to TypeScript, I noticed a significant reduction in runtime errors and an overall improvement in code quality. One particular project, which initially suffered from numerous bugs due to type mismatches, became much more stable and easier to extend once refactored into TypeScript."
paragraphThree: "In my first full-stack application, I aimed to replicate CS platform trading sites that had revenues of over 100 million. Despite my limited knowledge and reliance on JavaScript, I learned alot about TCP/SSL, sockets, ports, DNS, RESTful architecture, deploying in IaaS servers, and database design. However, I encountered significant runtime issues due to the lack of assistance from the compiler, which would not have been an issue, if I had used TypeScript. You can find the project on my GitHub portfolio. In addition, I created a video demonstrating the product's real-time functionality. You can access the video by clicking the project section and the video link button. Using TypeScript can help avoid many issues present in plain JavaScript. The type system helps to catch errors at compile-time, provides better tooling support, and enhances the developer experience. For junior developers, starting with TypeScript can establish a strong foundation for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code."
